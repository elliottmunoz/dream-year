        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Each year, a group of audacious people goes through a process to achieve a larger-than-life dream over the course of a year. The participants include everyone from filmmakers and activists to entrepreneurs and authors. No dream is too big, and no idea is too far-fetched.</p>
        <p><strong>The journey is called Dream Year.</strong></p>
        <p>There are three ways to participate: Attend a weekend retreat, where you'll learn how to bring a dream to life; pick-up a copy of the soon-to-be-released book Dream Year, which comes with access to a free online course; or contact us for coaching and on-site training.</p>
        <p><strong>Let the journey begin.</strong></p>

                <dt>January<span class="topic">Daring to Dream</span></dt>
                <dd>Most people know what their dream is; they're just too afraid to say it. Naming a dream invokes the forces of fear and insecurity. But you can do this. You're supposed to do it. That’s why the dream was given to you in the first place.</dd>
                
                <dt>March<span class="topic">Your Gift to the World</span></dt>
                <dd>You can go only as far as your gifts will take you. But being the “artist” is not your only option. You can also be the “producer” that orchestrates the work of other talented people. You'll join the ranks of other great producers, curators and directors in history.</dd>
                
                <dt>May<span class="topic">Your Financial Model</span></dt>
                <dd>A great idea is a spreadsheet with skin on. No dream can be sustained without a profitable financial model. And make no mistake – whether you're profit or non-profit – the goal is to make a profit. Otherwise, it’s not a dream; it’s a hobby.</dd>
								 <dt>July<span class="topic">How to be a Rainmaker</span></dt>
	                <dd>You can't delegate the task of creating revenue. No one will care as much as you. Revenue comes from making asks. And making asks comes from building high-trust relationships. Your job is to be a maker of friends.</dd>
                	<dt>September<span class="topic">Building a Platform</span></dt>
	                <dd>Nobody cares about your idea. There are too many brands, books, companies and causes vying for people’s attention. It’s the way of the social economy. By building a platform, you're creating a community of people who care.</dd>
									<dt>November<span class="topic">Growing the Business</span></dt>
	                <dd>Launching a dream requires learning from your mistakes until you get it right. It’s like trying to open a combination lock when you don’t know the numbers. You have to turn the tumblers one by one until you finally crack the code.</dd>
              </dl>
            </div>

              <dl>
	              <dt>February<span class="topic">Defining to Dream</span></dt>
                <dd>Every dream has a history. It didn’t begin just now. You can see traces of it all the way back to your childhood. Pursuing a dream is the culmination of every experience, talent and circumstance you've ever had. No moment has been wasted.</dd>
								<dt>April<span class="topic">Your Idea Model</span></dt>
                <dd>It’s not enough to have a great idea. The market is filled with them. What you need is a great idea model - a concept that people have never experienced before. It reinvents the industry, removes the competition and offers a unique experience to the world.</dd>
								<dt>June<span class="topic">Executing the Dream</span></dt>
                <dd>Every dreamer is made up of two people – “ordinary you” and “CEO you.” In order to bring your dream to life, “CEO you” must be in charge. From 30,000 feet, creating looks like art. From ground level, it’s a to-do list.</dd>
                <dt>August<span class="topic">Branding the Dream</span></dt>
                <dd>Branding is more than just design. It’s the quality of your product, the texture of your paper, the look of your photos and how you answer the phone. Branding is about the total user experience. And a great dream requires great branding. </dd>
                <dt>October<span class="topic">Marketing the Dream</span></dt>
                <dd>Marketing is about creating demand for your dream. Otherwise, you’re forced to sell your ideas through persuasion and incentives. Instead of going into sales, create a property that excites people and builds demand for what you do.</dd>
                <dt>December<span class="topic">Sustaining the Dream</span></dt>
                <dd>Most people don't quit because of failure. They quit because of discouragement, fear, worry and close-calls. So don't quit. Grow in your emotional fortitude. You'd be surprised to learn how close you've come to success.</dd>

There weren't enough families coming forward and the system was backed-up, leaving kids stranded in government-run shelters. Benjamin joined Dream Year to figure out a way to mobilize his city. We worked on a plan to create the 111Project by working alongside government leaders and inviting the city's faith community to welcome these kids home. Hundreds of families have answered the call.</dd>

At a time when print publications are losing readership and going out of business, Kate insisted on defying the odds and reprising an old medium. Kate joined Dream Year to figure out how to make her dream possible. Together, we explored new approaches and found a financial model that brought her new breathtaking Bittersweet Zine to life.</dd>

By working with us, Jenna has created the first patterns, enlisted backers and is bringing her first line to market. She's not only launching a successful business but helping to lift the esteem of women through her designs.</dd>

She knew her sensibilities were strong - her own house had been featured in Southern Living magazine and friends often hired her to decorate their homes as well. But she didn't know where to start. Amy joined Dream Year to turn her passion into a profession. We worked on gathering specialists around her, finding funding and turning her ideas into extraordinary homes through a company called Gather &amp; Build.</dd>

So Thomas joined Dream Year to bring a new interactive children's book series to life. We partnered to conceive a story about a community of Owls that travels the world to experience nature and learns values that will help them in life. The enchanting series is called Owlegories.</dd>

We worked with Justin to study the industry he was targeting, identify his target customer and shape some offerings that would sustain a new career.

We worked with Bryan on the concept for a new book, shaped a brand called Killer Tribes and helped him launch an annual event for bloggers. Bryan quit his job to work on it full-time.</dd>

                    <dd class="dream">John Finch was a salesman in Dallas, TX who couldn't shake the notion that he was supposed to help men become better fathers. His own dad had committed suicide when he was a young boy, and it took years for him to finally realize the damage it had done to him. But John didn't know what this new endeavor would look like, so he joined Dream Year to figure it out. We worked with John to begin developing a documentary film that would interview notable people about the role of fathers. The film and John's new organization The Perfect Father is spreading rapidly.</dd>

We worked with him to map out a strategy for a site that could update on its own and generate residual income for his already too-busy life. Nathan launched the site during an election season and quickly began to garner sponsors. The site continues to grow in readership.</dd>

We got rid of the unnecessary expenses, streamlined the purchasing and found ways to generate new streams of revenue.

		<h3>Dream Year Book</h3>      
		<div class="event-image"><img src="assets/images/book.jpg" /></div>
	        
	        <p>Studies show that most Americans hate their jobs. They despise their bosses, bemoan their working conditions and feel like they’re not making a difference in the world. On top of this, they’re frustrated by a dream that’s never been realized. But what can they do about it? They’re afraid to take risks; worried about paying the bills; and don’t know how to change their circumstances.</p> 
					<p>The book Dream Year lays out a one-year process that will help readers make the leap from a job they hate to a life they love. It will not only help them rediscover a life-long dream that got lost along the way, but also see it become a reality. There’s no dream too small and no idea too far-fetched. Dream Year is a book about doing what you love and making it your profession.</p>
					<p>Dream Year is due to hit stores in September 2014.</p>
